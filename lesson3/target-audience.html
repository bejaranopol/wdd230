        <h2>Target Audience</h2>
        <p>My audience is all people interested in dining out, entertainment, families, free time for all ages.
            The site will be used approximately by people between the ages of 13 to 60+. 
            I chose this population because in my city people are looking for rustic places/restaurants. </p>
